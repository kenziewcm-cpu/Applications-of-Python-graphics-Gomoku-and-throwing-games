Readme:
This project, developed in 2022, includes two games — a board game (Gomoku) and an animation-based throwing game — both implemented using Python graphics.

To start the program, simply run gamechoice.py in the project folder;
Then a selection interface will appear, allowing you to choose which game to play.

All game images and assets were hand-drawn by myself, giving the project a unique and personalized visual style.
